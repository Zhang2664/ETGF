# ETGF: Evaluate Face Generation from Fine-grained Textual Descriptions

## Overview



Left: The descriptions in existing databases are coarse and cannot meet the demand for real-world scenarios.  We expand the existing dataset with fineâ€‘grained face feature descriptions to facilitate the text-to-face-generation task.
Right: It is validated that the diffusion model trained on our benchmark can synthesize high-quality images that faithfully match the prompts.
